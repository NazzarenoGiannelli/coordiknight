This Blender addon allows you to copy the location/rotation/scaling of all the selected meshes in the scene to the clipboard and simply paste them into Unreal Engine has placeholder static meshes. Combined with Epic Games <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/BlenderTools">Send to Unreal</a> addon, it's a fast and efficient way to position many instances of the same mesh.

### Requirements
For the addon to work properly, you need to place the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/">pyperclip</a> Python module inside of your Blender installation folder.
I still need to find a nice way to automatically install it upon addon activation, so for now **you can find the pyperclip folder inside of the addon .zip.**
You can place that entire folder in this directory here: ..\Blender\2.XX\python\lib\site-packages
